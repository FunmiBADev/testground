How to build my python streamlit app project code artifacts  locally and use kubectl commands to deploy 

best practices:

Local Development Setup:

Create a Project Directory:

Use your terminal to create a new directory for your Streamlit app:
Bash
mkdir streamlit-app
cd streamlit-app
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Initialize Virtual Environment (Recommended):

Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # For Windows
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Install Streamlit:

Install Streamlit within the virtual environment:
Bash
pip install streamlit
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Develop Your Streamlit App:

Create a Python file (e.g., app.py) for your Streamlit app code. Here's a basic example:
Python
import streamlit as st

st.title("My Streamlit App")
st.write("Hello, world!")
Use code with caution.

Building Project Code Artifacts:

Streamlit apps typically don't require a specific build process like traditional web applications. The Python script itself is the primary artifact. However, you might have additional dependencies or requirements for deployment. Here are some considerations:

Packaging Dependencies:
If your app relies on external libraries beyond Streamlit, consider using tools like pip freeze to generate a requirements file (requirements.txt) listing the necessary packages. This file can be used to install dependencies in the deployment environment.
Bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Containerization (Optional):
For more complex deployments or if you want to bundle your app with its dependencies, containerization using Docker can be beneficial. Create a Dockerfile that specifies the base image (e.g., python:3.9), installs dependencies using RUN pip install -r requirements.txt, and copies your app code (app.py) into the container.
Deployment Using kubectl:

Prerequisites:

Kubernetes Cluster:
You'll need a Kubernetes cluster to deploy your app. If you don't have one locally, consider using tools like Minikube (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) or creating one on a cloud platform.
kubectl Configuration:
Ensure you have kubectl configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. Refer to your cluster's documentation for setup instructions.
Deployment Steps:

Create a Deployment:

Define a deployment manifest file (e.g., deployment.yaml) that instructs Kubernetes to create and manage pods running your app:
YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: streamlit-app  # Replace with your app's name
spec:
  replicas: 1  # Number of app replicas (usually 1)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: streamlit-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: streamlit-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: streamlit-app
        image: your-image-name:latest  # Replace with your image name if using Docker
        port:
          containerPort: 8501  # Streamlit's default port
        command: ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]  # Streamlit command to run your app
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Apply the Deployment:

Use kubectl apply to create the deployment in your cluster:
Bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Verify Deployment:

Check if the deployment is running successfully:
Bash
kubectl get deployments
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Expose the Service (Optional):

If you want to access your app externally, create a Service to expose the deployment's pods:
YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: streamlit-app-service  # Replace with your service name
spec:
  selector:
    app: streamlit-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80  # External port (can be different from container port)
    targetPort: 8501  # Port to forward to the deployment's pods
  type: LoadBalancer  # Optional: Use LoadBalancer for external access
